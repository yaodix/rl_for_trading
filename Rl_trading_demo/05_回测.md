### Key Performance Metrics:

* **Cumulative Return** : Total return over the backtest period.
* **Annualized Return** : Converts cumulative return to an annual figure.
* **Sharpe Ratio** : Assesses risk-adjusted return. Higher is better.
* **Maximum Drawdown** : Largest drop from peak to trough — crucial for risk understanding.
* **Win Rate** : Percentage of profitable trades; consider alongside profit per trade and risk.
* **Profit Factor** : Ratio of gross profit to gross loss; greater than one indicates profitability.
* **Sortino Ratio** : Focuses on downside risk, offering clear insight into risk management.

### Robustness and Contextual Analysis:

* Compare metrics against benchmarks to understand true performance.
* Analyze across bull, bear, and sideways markets for strategy robustness.
* Use market indicators like volatility to fine-tune strategies, avoiding overfitting.

### Robustness Tests:

* **Walk-forward analysis** ,  **Out-of-sample testing** ,  **Monte Carlo simulations** , and  **Parameter sensitivity analysis** : Ensure adaptability and reliability under varied conditions.

## Biases & Pitfalls

Creating accurate and dependable backtests for trading strategies requires awareness of common biases and errors. Below are core insights to refine backtesting processes:

### Look-ahead Bias

* **Description:** Using future data to predict past events.
* **Solution:** Ensure trading decisions are based solely on information available at the time.

### Overfitting

* **Description:** Strategies tailored too closely to historical data.
* **Solution:** Simplify with fewer parameters, test on different data segments, and reserve untested data for validation.

### Data Snooping Bias（数据窥探偏见)

数据窥探行为（Data-Snooping Practices）是指在策略开发过程中，通过反复试验和调整来拟合历史数据的各种做法。这些行为会导致回测结果过于乐观，但在实盘交易中失败。

* **Description:** Testing many strategies on the same data increases chance findings.
* **Solution:** Apply statistical adjustments（统计调整方法）) and validate on separate datasets.

### Survivorship Bias（幸存者偏差)

* **Description:** Ignoring data from delisted securities.
* **Solution:** Use datasets that include both active and inactive securities.

### Transaction Costs（交易成本)

* **Description:** Overlooking costs can overstate results.
* **Solution:** Accurately estimate costs and test performance across scenarios.

### Data Accuracy

* **Description:** Incomplete data leads to flawed tests.
* **Solution:** Use accurate, comprehensive data and confirm integrity before testing.
